In textualfile.txt hint to be extracted is that the participant must figure out that they have to deal with the Audio file and then proceed with remaining as we have specified about the story of ALibaba and Fourty Thieves.


Now we extract the text file[LATIN_GIBBERISH_ERStwHile.txt] present in the Audio File[RAW.wav] using the password specified in the textualfile.txt[20235IEEE].


In LATIN_GIBBERISH_ERStwHile.txt ,copy the contents[EYEPOPAE] into this link[https://www.dcode.fr/latin-gibberish] we end up with [POPEYE],this is the pwd for the Genshin.pdf.


In Genshin.pdf, we decypt the given pattern using this link[https://www.dcode.fr/sumeru-language-genshin-impact] where we end up with [RAITAPELPAKNEEENSES].
Now in LATIN_GIBBERISH_ERStwHile.txt we have mentioned about jumbling with repect to two words [LUMINALNEXUS & ASTROGING].


Which implies we have to perform Double Transposition on[RAITAPELPAKNEEENSES] wrt [LUMINALNEXUS & ASTROGING] in this link[https://www.dcode.fr/double-transposition-cipher],
We end up with the final answer [IEEEPRESENTSKALPANA].
