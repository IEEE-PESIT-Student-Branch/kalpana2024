The Following Two hints were embedded in the KENnel_New_York.txt.
HINT 1:
The security phrase for accessing the gpg file is-FmpMmmPppMfmPpfMmpPffMmmFpmPpf .
HINT 2:
The access phrase for extracting the gpg file is encrpyted and presented to you in front-PmmFmfPmfMffMppFmpMpmMppPmfFmpMmm.

Now on finding the two irregular words from the text .
We also get to know the Name of the cipher used by accumulating all the uppercase letters from the name of the textual file.
After this we decrypt the two passwords using this link[https://www.dcode.fr/kenny-code-southpark].
We end up with[TANGOBRAVO] for Accessing and [JULIETDELTA] for extracting.
on using the above two pwds we get the contents of ATtackBAseSHip.txt,
we have to now decrypt the messages present in ATtackBAseSHip.txt.
The name of the cipher[ATBASH] used is the accumulation of all the uppercase letters from the name of the textual file.
Now on decrypting the ATtackBAseSHip.txt,we end up with [LIMAPAPA] as the password for accessing the file present in the image[USS.jpg] and [ROMEOMIKE]as the password for Extracting  the file present in the image[USS.jpg].
The name of the cipher[OOK!] used is the accumulation of all the uppercase letters from the name of the textual file.
NOW on decrypting it using this link[https://www.dcode.fr/ook-language] we get [ECHO] as the password for VULtureCANdle.pdf.
In the VULtureCANdle.pdf ,The name of the cipher[VULCAN] used is the accumulation of all the uppercase letters from the name of the textual file,PLEASE USE THIS LINK[https://www.dcode.fr/vulcan-language] TO decrypt the pattern present in VULtureCANdle.pdf.

After that we end up with IEEE(HEAD)=BIGGUY
