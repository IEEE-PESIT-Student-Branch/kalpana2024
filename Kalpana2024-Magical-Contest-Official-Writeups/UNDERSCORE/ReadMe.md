When we press [Ctrl] and [U] together  on the website we end up with HTML file of the  website.
In that when we inspect 
1.LINK[https://druvanewwebsite.vercel.app/img/YOUNGER_FUTure_HARKens.png] present in line number[54],which inturn is the flag1.
The name of the cipher[younger futhark] used is the accumulation of all uppercase letters present in the url.
Now we get to decrypt this image using this link[https://www.dcode.fr/younger-futhark] we end up with [HEALTHHACKING IS].


2.LINK[https://druvanewwebsite.vercel.app/bg-img/futureZODIACKILLERmike.png]present in line number[150],which inturn is the flag2.
The name of the cipher[ZODIACKILLER] used is the accumulation of all uppercase letters present in the url.
Now we get to decrypt this image using this link[https://www.dcode.fr/zodiac-killer-cipher] we end up with [CONDUCTED].


3.TWITTER LINK[https://twitter.com/KRDruva1] ,on pressing this link or pressing the link twitter button on the end of the website,we end up with the FLAG 3(ELEMENTS REPRESENTSED BY ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATION)::-1s2 2s2 2p1 [Kr] 4d1 5s2 [Rn] 6d2 7s2 E.


4.LINK[https://www.instagram.com/dr_s_sd_s/] ,This link was hidden in the html file and the participants couldnt find this flag is because the author had given the anchor tag to nothing.
In this Insta Acc when we examin the last post of the author we find out the name of the flag to be the caption of the post and in the comments of the post we have hid the flag 4:-[籝籎籌籑籝籎籊籖]which when on decrypting  on this link[https://www.dcode.fr/rot8000-cipher] we get [TECHTEAM] as Flag4.


Now the last flag is left out.When we inspect the page using [Ctrl & U] we have to navigate access [/libs/ios-drag-drop.js],in that particular file we find FLAG5:-twos complement of 011111010110,

when we convert it we end up with 2090 as the last flag.
